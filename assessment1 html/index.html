<h3>3. What are self-closing tags?</h3>

<p>In HTML, A self-closing tag is a type of tag that need not to be closed by closing tag, which means there is no separate closing tag for it as </tag>.
    </p>
   
    <p> 
        Elements that don't have any content are called empty elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line break).

  <h3>5. Difference between block and inline?</h3>
   <p>
    A block element always begins on a new line and extends to left and right, and it takes the full width available on the webpage. Browsers automatically add some space(margin) before and after element.
   </p>
   <p>
    An inline element does not begin on a new line. It only takes the space that is necessary for it.

   <h3> 6. Difference between em and strong tag ?</h3>
   <p>
   
        The strong and em tags are used for emphasizing parts of a text.
            The strong tag should be used to indicate strong importance, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it.
   </p>
   <p>
    The em tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice. Both tags can be used together, where it makes sense.
